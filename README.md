 Covid Project on Facial Recognition Software
 
 Made by Adarsh Kumar and Tulip Pandey
 
 Description - 
 
 A software that detects faces, classifies the input images as real or fake and finally matches the real faces with the entries in the dataset, returning the best match. The recognition  of faces has been done using an SVM model and the liveness  detection ( fake/ real) classification has been done using a CNN model, trained on our own dataset.
